Here are some motto ideas rolling around in my head. Anneka mentioned having three words, so here goes. Some may be cornier than others.

Embark, explore, engage.
Curiosity, brio, endeavour
Explore your world.
Unlock the wonder around you (?? and too long).
Wander more. Wonder more. 
Wander farther, wonder further. 
Embark on your journey.
Always be curious.
Spark your adventure. 
Be curious always. 
Inquire, indentify, investigate.

Other words/fragments that come to mind: urban wild(erness), identify/record/observe (traditional usage of a field guide).

That's all for now...
