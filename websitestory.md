#Website Story

Last year, we had a very short window to set up Teen Summer Adventure. As a result, we had virtually no online presence aside from the webpage on Teen Central giving minimal details about the project. The program was still an amazing success in terms of uptake, however. We feel that in 2017, using the new website to highlight TSA would only benefit the program further and ensure that there is adequate online interaction, engagement and information to reach out to the youth communiity. 

According to our statistics last year, younger teens were by far the largest demographic who participated in TSA. They likely graduated from SRC, and are familiar with the way you participate in SRC. It would be great to capture younger teens graduating grade seven with TSA, a new program which is less well known. 

With the teen portion of the library's website, it would be great to publicize how TSA works:  Register at any Surrey Libraries branch, pick up your passport, read and complete the challenges that interest you. Return to get ballots which go toward prize draws. 

In addition to registration instructions, we would also like to have a FAQs section which publicizes what the prizes are, what happens if you lose your passport, etc. 

We think it would also be amazing if there were a way we could showcase on website what teens are doing with TSA.  Teens can show off to peers what they have submitted to us via some of the email challenges, and the library community as a whole can see what teens are creating and exploring through this library endeavour. For younger teens especially, their parents generally check the library website on their children's behalf, so it would be a great opportunity to showcase accomplishments done by fellow TSA members to encourage more young people to participate.  

In order to better assess Teen Summer Adventure and evaluate its outcomes, we'd also like to include an online survey for teens to complete, with the chance to win prizes for entering the survey. Last year, the survey was at the back of the booklet, and despite the fact that it's indicated that the survey should be submitted to the branch, I think many teens simply filled out the survey, received ballots for it, but it remained in their booklets.
