#Website Story

TeenRC was only online and it was easy to direct people to but there was a disconnect between us and the website

Last year we had a very short window to set up Teen Summer Adventure and so we had essentially no online presence

We had huge uptake in TSA without this online component however we see adding online interaction, engagement and information as an opportunity to reach even more teens, and engage those teens who do participate in even more ways.

Sign up process for TSA is not particularly more complex than SRC - Come sign up at the library! 

However TSA is not well known. Everyone pretty much knows how SRC works. Read everyday/read a certain number of books and get a medal.

We want to publicize how TSA works: Complete adventures--each completed adventure gets you more chances to win--Win Prizes! except say it better and prettier.

We want to tease/publicise some of the adventures

We want to publicize what the prizes are. 

We want to allow for adventures that require submitting something more complex that something written down in their booklet: pictures, writing, videos, etc

We want a way to show off what teens are submitting, to validate them, to show teens what their peers are creating in conjunction with TSA, to show parents what teens are doing, to have to show the library community what the teens are doing, creating etc

We would like to have an online version of the exit survey to hopefully get more feedback
