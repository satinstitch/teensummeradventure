#Website Story

TeenRC was only online and it was easy to direct people to but there was a disconnect between us and the website

Last year we had a very short window to set up Teen Summer Adventure and so we had essentially no online presence

While we had huge uptake in TSA without this online component we see adding online interaction, engagement and information as an opportunity to reach even more teens, and engage those teens who do participate in even more ways.

While the sign up process for TSA is not particularly more complex than SRC - Come sign up at the library!
