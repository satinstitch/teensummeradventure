Synopsis

Brainstorming repository for the teen summer adventure project

Code Example

Teen Summer Adventure is an analog program similar to Summer Reading Club but for Teens. 
Adventures are collected in a booklet that is handed out to teens over the summer.
Adventures are worth entries to win prizes.

Motivation

Teen Summer Adventure aims to get teens connected to their libraries, their communities and lifelong learning and literacy.
We hope that sharing our development process, brainstorming and files will help other libraries or organizations interested in developing similar initiatives.
We also hope that other organizations or individuals will share with us their thoughts and ideas on the project
