#Meeting Agenda

##Registration decisions

a.	Looking at doing full registration (school, phone and email) – email challenges, resolve ticket issues: Feedback – why so much personal info, why both phone and email?

b.	Code number for each teen – generic draw ticket would just have code and each branch would have to input that info into D drive.  Feedback – feels like a lot of work/date entry for staff

c.	Decrease number of tickets?  Feedback – overall staff thought yes

d.	We like Option 2 – same number/difficulty of challenges, but worth fewer tickets (1, 2 and 3 – fewer 3’s)
Have a spot on the passport to write their number so that they won’t forget it

So…for points A and B, not a lot of enthusiasm for gathering more personal info, and for having each branch put info on D drive. In comparison to SRC, it does seem like a lot more work, but, compared to registration for regular programs, it is not too much more information than what we would already gather. Phone AND email is a good idea because teens may not respond to one or the other. We do need to be mindful that there is adult SRC happening too, though, so we need to strike a balance of just the right amount of info. What are your thoughts about the feedback? Do we need more specific feedback or can we move forward from here?
